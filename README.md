Bye decider that reads from https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/CubeByeAffinities/blob/master/players.txt

In round 1 it picks the top 4 players (or more if there's a tie at #4) and selects one of them to get the bye, weighted by affinity.

In subsequent rounds it just tells you who has the highest affinity of those you selected
